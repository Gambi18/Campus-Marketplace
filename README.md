## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Docker only** (recommended): Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine + Compose v2 (Linux). Nothing else required.
- **Manual setup**: Node.js 18+, Go 1.25+, PostgreSQL 15+

### Quick start (Docker)

Works identically on Linux and Windows (Docker Desktop / WSL2). From the repo root:

```bash
# Optional: copy the env template and edit it (the stack also runs with no .env)
cp .env.example .env

# Build images and start everything (Postgres + backend + frontend)
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:8080 (health check at `/health`)
- Postgres: localhost:5432

Database migrations run automatically on backend startup, and the default admin
is seeded on first boot (`admin@campusmarket.local` / `password` unless overridden).

Stop and remove containers with `docker compose down` (add `-v` to also wipe the
database and uploaded-files volumes).

#### Hot-reload development

Mounts your source into the containers so edits are picked up live (file-watch
polling is enabled so this works on Windows/WSL2 too):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

Frontend changes reload automatically. After editing Go code, restart the backend
container (`docker compose restart backend`) to rebuild.

> Make shortcuts: `make docker-up`, `make docker-dev`, `make docker-down`, `make docker-logs`.

#### Configuration

All settings have safe dev defaults, so `docker compose up` works out of the box.
Override them via a root `.env` file (see `.env.example`). Note `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
/ `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` are **baked into the frontend at build time** and must be
reachable from the browser — keep them as `localhost:8080` for local use, or set
your public host and rebuild (`docker compose up --build`) when deploying remotely.

> **Windows note:** the repo ships a `.gitattributes` that forces LF line endings,
> so Docker builds work on Windows checkouts. If you cloned before it was added and
> hit "exec format" errors, run `git rm --cached -r . && git reset --hard` to
> re-normalize, or ensure your editor saves these files with LF.

### Manual setup
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && cp .env.example .env && go mod download && go run cmd/api/main.go

# Frontend
cd frontend && cp .env.example .env.local && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Deployment (free tier, no credit card)

**Live deployment**

| | URL |
|---|-----|
| Frontend | https://campus-marketplace-hjod.vercel.app |
| Backend API | https://campus-marketplace-gn71.onrender.com (health: `/health`) |

The three parts host best on three services. The Go backend runs a **persistent
WebSocket hub**, so it needs a long-running process — not serverless functions.
Deployments track the `deploy` branch on both Render and Vercel.

| Component | Platform | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Frontend (Next.js) | **Vercel** | Root Directory `frontend`, Framework Preset **Next.js**. |
| Backend (Go + WS) | **Render** free Web Service (Docker) | `render.yaml` blueprint, Root Directory `backend`. |
| Database (Postgres) | **Neon** free tier | Doesn't expire (Render's free Postgres deletes after 30 days). |
| Images / receipts | **Cloudinary** | Required — Render's free disk is ephemeral. |

**Steps**

1. **Neon** — create a project; note host, database, user, password. Use the
   **direct** (non-`-pooler`) host and `DB_SSLMODE=require` — golang-migrate takes
   a session advisory lock at startup that the pooled endpoint doesn't support.
2. **Render** — New → Blueprint, pointing at `render.yaml` (it sets `rootDir: backend`).
   Fill the `sync: false` env vars: the Neon `DB_*` values,
   `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://<your-vercel-domain>`, `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   (not `password`), and the `CAMPAY_*` / `CLOUDINARY_*` credentials. `JWT_SECRET`
   is generated automatically. Migrations run — and the first admin is seeded — on boot.
3. **CamPay dashboard** — set the webhook URL to `https://<render-backend>/webhook/campay`.
4. **Vercel** — import the repo with **Root Directory `frontend`** and **Framework
   Preset Next.js**, then set build-time env (baked into the bundle):
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<render-backend>` and
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://<render-backend>` (**wss**, since Render serves HTTPS).
5. Update Render's `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the final Vercel domain and redeploy.

> **Free-tier trade-off:** the Render Web Service spins down after ~15 min idle
> and cold-starts (~50s) on the next request; WebSockets reconnect on wake. This
> is fine for demos. The CamPay webhook still wakes the service, so payments are
> not lost.

**Gotchas we hit (and fixed on the `deploy` branch)**

- **Monorepo build context** — both platforms need the Root Directory set
  (`backend` / `frontend`), or the build can't find `go.mod` / `package.json`.
- **Next.js standalone on Vercel** — `next.config.js` gates `output: 'standalone'`
  on `process.env.VERCEL` so it applies to the Docker image but not Vercel.
- **Next.js 16 Edge middleware** — a `next/server` middleware pulls in
  `ua-parser-js` and 404s the whole site on Vercel, so route protection lives in a
  client-side `AuthGuard` (`frontend/app/components/AuthGuard.tsx`) instead.
- **Vercel Framework Preset must be Next.js** — if left as "Other", Vercel serves
  the build as static files and every route 404s.
- **Payment bypass is hard-disabled** on `deploy` (`devBypassEnabled()` returns
  `false`), so real CamPay collection is always enforced in production.

## Platform Model

- **Peer-to-peer:** All authenticated students can browse, list, and message. No buyer/seller roles.
- **Two account types:** Students (`users` table) and admins (`admins` table), separate login endpoints, JWT `actor_type` claim.
- **Account statuses:** `pending` → `approved` | `rejected` | `blocked`. Pending/rejected/blocked cannot log in.

### Admin bootstrap

The platform needs a first admin before any admin can log in, which is a chicken-and-egg problem (admin endpoints require an admin token). There are two ways to create that first admin, both of which only work while the `admins` table is **empty**:

1. **Seed on startup (default).** Set `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. On boot, `EnsureDefaultAdmin` creates the admin if none exists. Best for self-hosted deployments where you control the environment.

2. **One-time HTTP bootstrap.** Set `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` to a long random secret and call:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://<host>/api/v1/admin/create \
     -H "X-Admin-Bootstrap-Token: <ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"root","email":"admin@example.com","password":"<strong-password>"}'
   ```

   This endpoint is public by necessity (no admin token can exist yet) but is guarded two ways: the request must carry the matching `X-Admin-Bootstrap-Token` header (constant-time compared), **and** it only succeeds while no admin exists. Once any admin is created — by either method — the endpoint returns `403` permanently. If `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` is unset, the endpoint is disabled (`403`) and only the seed path is available.

   After bootstrapping, rotate or unset `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` — the bootstrap endpoint is inert anyway once an admin exists.

### Adding more admins (in-app)

Once a first admin exists, further admins are created from the dashboard — no bootstrap token needed:

- **UI:** sign in at `/admin/login` → **Admins → Add admin** (`/admin/admins`), enter a username, email and password. The new admin can sign in immediately.
- **API:** `POST /api/v1/admin/admins` (admin-authenticated) with `{username, email, password}`; `GET /api/v1/admin/admins` lists existing admins. Duplicate emails return `409`, and each creation is written to the audit log (`create_admin`).

## Payment Flow (Escrow via CamPay)

1. Product detail → "Pay to Chat" button → enter phone number → CamPay USSD prompt
2. Confirm on phone → payment held in escrow → chat unlocked
3. Buyer reviews item → confirms delivery → payment released to seller (minus 3% fee)
4. Buyer cancels → refund to buyer (minus 1% fee)
5. PDF receipt generated and stored on Cloudinary

**Chat gating:** Message sending (WebSocket) and listing/message history (REST) both check for active payment. Set `DEV_BYPASS_PAYMENT=true` on the backend to bypass for testing — this is ignored when `ENV=production`, so it can never disable real payments in a live deployment.

## Key Design Decisions

- **No GORM, no MongoDB** — raw SQL via sqlc, PostgreSQL only
- **Images stored on Cloudinary** — four columns (`image_url_1`..`image_url_4`)
- **Payments via CamPay mobile money** — MTN & Orange, USSD prompt flow
- **3% platform fee on sale** (configurable in `config.go`)
- **1% platform fee on refund** (configurable in `config.go`)
- **Notifications** — in-app via WebSocket + email via queue (DB table)

## API Endpoints

See the route definitions in `backend/internal/handlers/routes.go` for the complete list. Key groups:
- **Public:** health, register, login, categories, products (list/search/detail), webhook
- **Protected (student JWT):** profile, my-products, CRUD products, reports (`product_id` + `reason` ∈ `fake_listing|wrong_price|scam|inappropriate|other` + optional `details` ≤250 chars), conversations, messages, payments (initiate/status/confirm/reject/receipt), purchases, sales
- **Admin (admin JWT):** users, pending-users, approve/reject/block, categories CRUD, reports (reporter, product, reason, details, status), held payments

## Environment Variables

### Backend (`backend/.env.example`)
- `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` / `DB_USER` / `DB_PASSWORD` / `DB_NAME` (the DSN is built from these)
- `JWT_SECRET` (**required** — the server refuses to start without it)
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated CORS/WebSocket origin allow-list)
- `ADMIN_*` (default admin seed — see [Admin bootstrap](#admin-bootstrap)), `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` (one-time HTTP admin bootstrap secret)
- `DEV_BYPASS_PAYMENT` (testing only; simulates payments — ignored when `ENV=production`)
- `CLOUDINARY_*` (optional — falls back to local `./uploads` if unset), `CAMPAY_*`

### Frontend (`frontend/.env.example`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`

## UI-only (not yet in API)
- Meetup `location` field (collected in listing wizard, not persisted)

## Admin Dashboard

Routes: `/admin/login` → `/admin/users`, `/admin/categories`, `/admin/payments`, `/admin/reports`
